# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Q1)**

The objective of MSA MOWING is to provide a comprehensive web application for managing your mowing business. It seeks to streamline operations, improve customer experience, and boost overall efficiency by providing features for customer administration, expense tracking, income management, a to-do list, and impending activities.

Functionality / Features:
Customer Management: I can efficiently manage and organize customer information, such as their contact information and service history. This enables me to give personalized service and seamless communication.
Expense Tracking: With the expense tracking function, I can simply record and categorize expenses relevant to my mowing service. It enables me to compile expense reports, analyze costs, and make sound financial decisions.
Income Management: MSAMOWING enables me to successfully manage the income and revenue generated by my mowing services. I can manage payments, generate invoices, and obtain useful information about my company's financial status.
To-Do List: The to-do list function keeps me organized by giving me a place to create, prioritize, and manage mowing-related chores. It keeps me on top of critical activities and maintains a productive workflow.
MSAMOWING also provides a simple display of forthcoming chores, appointments, or deadlines. This function allows me to efficiently arrange my schedule and guarantee that key tasks are completed on time.

The intended audience is as follows:
My MSAMOWING web software is primarily intended for professionals or businesses involved in lawn mowing. It is designed to meet the demands of lawn care providers, mowing contractors, and business owners like myself who handle mowing services.

Tech Stack: I used the following tech stack to bring MSAMOWING to life:
React JS is a sophisticated JavaScript library for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
JavaScript (JS): The major programming language that will be used to build my web app.
HTML is the industry standard markup language for creating web pages.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides preset classes for quick and effective web app styling.
MongoDB is a flexible NoSQL database that allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of customer, expense, income, and task-related data.
Express.js is a Node.js web application framework that powers the server-side of my web project.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows for server-side development, allowing you to create the backend of your webapp

This technology stack enables me to develop a modern, responsive, and feature-rich web application while also providing seamless data management and server-side functionality.

With MSAMOWING, I have the tools and capabilities to operate my mowing business more efficiently and give a better experience for both myself and my customers.

The User's Web Browser represents the client-side where users visit the web app. It transmits and receives HTTP requests from the web server.

The Web Server processes HTTP requests from the user's web browser and delivers back the appropriate replies. It serves as a bridge between the client and the application server.

The business logic, API endpoints, application functionality, and data processing are all handled by the Application Server. It takes web server requests, processes them, interacts with the database, and returns results to the web server.
The Database component, such as MongoDB, is responsible for storing and retrieving data required by the application. It manages data persistence and provides a way for interacting with the data that has been saved.

**Q4)**

  

As a homeowner, I want to easily schedule a lawn mowing service at my preferred date and time, so I can maintain the appearance of my lawn without hassle.

As a user, I want to have a user account where I can view my past appointments, update my personal information, and track the status of my upcoming appointments.

As a lawn mowing operator, I want to be able to view a map or directions to the customer's location, helping me navigate to their property without any confusion.

As an administrator, I want to generate reports on income, expenses, and profitability, allowing me to analyse the financial performance of my mowing business and make data-driven decisions.

**Q5)**

I have created wireframes for multiple standard screen sizes using industry-standard software. These wireframes serve as the foundation for the visual design of my dashboard interface. With careful consideration of various screen sizes, I aim to ensure a responsive and seamless user experience across devices. These wireframes provide me with a clear roadmap for implementing my design vision and bringing the dashboard to life.
